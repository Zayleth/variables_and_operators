// Exercise:
// 1. Multiply 10 with 5, and alert the result:
alert(10 * 5); // 50


// 2. Divide 10 by 2, and alert the result:
alert(10 / 2); // 5

// 3. Alert the remainder when 15 is divided by 9.
alert(15 % 9); // 6

// 4. Use the correct assignment operator that will result in x being 15 (same as x = x + y).

x = 10;
y = 5;

x += y; // 15. Addition assignment

// 5. Use the correct assignment operator that will result in x being 50 (same as x = x * y).

x = 10;
y = 5;

x *= y; // 50. Multiplication assignment
