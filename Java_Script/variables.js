// A variable is a "named storage" for data. We can use variables to store data from our code.
// Each variable has a label with a unique name
// To create a variable in JavaScript; 
// let = 'keyword'; is a modern variable declaration.
// var = 'variable_declaration'; is an old-school variable declaration. Normally we don’t use it at all. it has its differences with let
// const = 'value that does not change or constant value'

// Variables can have any name assigned to them, except reserved names specified by Java Script. These are

    //let
    //class
    //return
    //functions


// NOTE - Variables should be named in a way that allows us to easily understand what’s inside them.

// TASKS - Working with variables
// Declare two variables: admin and name.
// Assign the value "John" to name.
// Copy the value from name to admin.
// Show the value of admin using alert (must output “John”).



let name = "John";

let admin = 'name';

alert( admin ); // "John"

console.log (admin);
